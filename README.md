# Catch The Kenny

# Description

Catch The Kenny is a simple and fun Android game where the player must "catch" Kenny by tapping on randomly appearing images within a limited time frame. The game is developed in Kotlin and uses Android's native UI components, timers, and event handling to create a fast-paced experience. Players can challenge themselves to score as high as possible before the time runs out!

# Features

  - Time-Based Gameplay: The game runs on a timer, with Kenny randomly appearing in different spots.
  - Interactive UI: Players can tap on the Kenny image to score points.
  - Restart or Exit Game: After the game ends, users can choose to restart or exit.
  - Dynamic Image Handling: Kenny appears in random locations, creating a dynamic and unpredictable experience.
  - Edge-to-Edge Design Support: The app supports edge-to-edge designs for a more immersive experience.
# Usage

  - Start the Game: Once the app launches, the timer starts, and images of Kenny will begin to appear in random positions on the screen.
  - Catch Kenny: Tap on Kenny before he disappears to increase your score.
  - Game Over: When the timer runs out, an alert will ask if you want to restart the game or exit.
  - Restart: Choose "Yes" in the game-over alert to restart the game and try to beat your score.
